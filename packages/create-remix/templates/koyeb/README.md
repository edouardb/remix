## Koyeb Setup

1. Sign up and log in to [Koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com/)

## Development

From your terminal, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you should be ready to go!

## Deployment

To deploy on Koyeb, you need to create a new [**App**](https://app.koyeb.com/apps/new) using the Koyeb git-driven deployment method. Using git-driven deployment, each time you push code changes to your GitHub repository a new build and deployment are triggered automatically on the Koyeb Serverless Platform.

On the create **App** page:

1. Select GitHub as the deployment method
2. Select the GitHub repository containing your app and specify the branch to deploy
3. Give your App a name
4. Click the **Create App** button
